# Introduction

We are team C. Task 1 (editing the README.md) has been done. Next, we will include data into this file. After that, the project board will be created.

Then, some of us will write a piece of C program, which will be posted below.

Finally, we will promote our repo to the CSCI3250 organization, and wait for @chuckjee to check ;)

good luck~
